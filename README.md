Here are topics from the thrid and final course in the University of Washington's (UW) series on iOS and Mac Development. Since the homework for this course is a complete project (NoFilter) which encompasses all of the topics covered in this course, the NoFilter project can be found in a separate GitHub repository. Therefore several of the folders here are class demos by Tim Ekl and in class excercies by me. Also presented here are lessons and homeworks from the French MOOC (FUN) spring course on iOS Development
